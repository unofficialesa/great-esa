Contrary to the Github convention, this repository (Great-esa) contains not only the code, but also other works, captured photos, reports for submission, and ppt files.
Uploading these files to Github is not for cooperation and contribution in mind, but to back up and permanently preserve the files, so that anyone can view the work of our unofficialESA team.

For this reason, the[`COPYING`](COPYING.md)of this repository was written not to simply follow the GPL License.

Given that the license policy of Github and fsf is not suitable for non-code projects like this, we define the license of our repository as follows.

We propose our project -GreatESA- as Composite Work, and the copyright is
Each individual on the UnofficialESA team has

[[Korea Supreme Court Judgment 2004 M639 Performance Ban Provisional Decision]](https://www.law.go.kr/precInfoP.do?mode=0&evtNo=2004ë§ˆ639)

This decision is for the prosperity and cooperation of the open source and free software camps, and at the same time, to protect the freedom and rights of members of the UnofficialESA team.

Therefore, all use of Github for this purpose is protected by GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3.0, and the protected contents include Code and Repository Concept.
In other words, the license of this Repository is divided into two.
